2008 Crime Data: Exploration 1
Author: Sherri Verdugo, M.S.
========================================================

## Introduction 

This is based on the shiny tutorial for reading in census data and population demographics. With minor modifications, I was able to create a crime map using US county crime data statistics.

## Data folder

The data folder contains the cleaner file for the crime data.

## App location

The app is hosted at: https://census-homicide.shinyapps.io/murder_rate/

## Future Plans 

Future plans include a real time application of tracking crime by county zip code as well.

### Review 

This was a fun experience overall.
